SQL project demonstrating data analysis using PostgreSQL
# SQL Data Analysis Project

## 👨‍💻 Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze and extract insights from data using SQL. I have used PostgreSQL to create tables, write queries, and generate reports using key SQL techniques including SELECT statements, JOINS, subqueries, aggregate functions, views, and indexes.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- PostgreSQL (via psql shell)
- SQL
- Screenshots for output documentation

## 🧪 Tasks Completed

### ✅ Section A: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- Fetched all employee records
- Filtered by department and salary
- Ordered results by salary
- Grouped by department and calculated average salary

### ✅ Section B: JOINs
- Joined `employees` and `departments` tables to show manager details

### ✅ Section C: Subqueries
- Used a subquery to find employees earning more than the average salary

### ✅ Section D: Views
- Created a view named `high_earners` to quickly show employees earning above 60,000

### ✅ Section E: Aggregate Functions
- Calculated total, average, min, max, and count of salaries grouped by department

### ✅ Section F: Indexes
- Created indexes on `department` and `salary` columns to optimize performance

## 📊 Insights Gained

- IT department has the highest total salary
- HR department has the fewest employees
- Employees earning above the average salary tend to be in IT and Sales
- Indexes help speed up filtering queries, especially with large datasets

## 💬 Notes

This project is a demonstration of SQL fundamentals for data analysis and is designed to be extended with larger, real-world datasets in future projects.
